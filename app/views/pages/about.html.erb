        The interactive map is at the core of the app, letting you explore nearby venues visually. Tap on a pin to learn more about upcoming performances, venue details, and featured artists. Filters make it easy to narrow results by genre, venue type, or event format (indoor/outdoor/cover-free).
      </p>

      <p>
        Venue owners and artists can manage their profiles, post events, and build their audiences. Users can follow favorite artists and venues, create an account, and stay updated on who’s playing where.

      <h4>How does the map work?</h4>
      <p>
        The map displays live music events occurring within the next 12 hours based on your current location. Use filters to find specific genres, venue types, or event settings like indoor, outdoor, or cover-free.

      <h4>How does favoriting an artist or venue work?</h4>
      <p>
        When you follow an artist or venue, you’ll be able to filter the map to only show events from your favorites. In the future, you’ll also receive personalized notifications when new matching events are posted.
