      <h4>Post Your Events</h4>

        Once you're signed in, head to your dashboard to post an event. Add the date, time, venue, genre, and more. 
        If you're playing at a venue that's already on BarChord, the owner can also create the event and tag you.

        Fans can follow you to keep track of your upcoming performances. Theyâ€™ll receive personalized notifications when you announce new shows.

      <h4>Boost Your Reach</h4>
      <p>
        Add your Instagram, TikTok, or Spotify links to your artist profile to make it easy for fans to explore your music and follow you beyond the app.
